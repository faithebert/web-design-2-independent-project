    <div class="why-adopt">
      <img src="images/png/Why-adopt-cat.png" alt="">
      <p>Adoption shelter staff will help you through every step of finding your special friend, one that is just right for you. They will answer questions, help you decide which pet is a good match for you, and be available for advice following your pet adoption. When you adopt your pet, not only do you get a wonderful friend:</p>
      <ul class="adoption-reasons semi-bold">
        <li>You also help the many more animals still waiting for their chance, and those that have been rescued from abuse and neglect.</li>
        <li>You help eliminate the cruelty and misery in puppy and kitten mills.</li>
        <li>You give an animal an incredible gift – a second chance to find happiness and love</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Adopting from a shelter is a wonderful way to give a homeless pet a secure and loving home. Typically shelters have a deep understanding of the temperament and health of the animals in their care and will provide you with a full background assessment, including the animal’s tolerance and attitude towards children. The priority for shelters is to find a lasting, compatible match between an owner and a pet that brings joy and a daily dose of happiness to all family members.</p>
      <p>Very few things in life can compare to the unconditional love, companionship and fun given by our animal friends!</p>
      <p>If it’s time for a new pet in your life, you will surely find your perfect companion at the Arnprior & District Humane Society. There are so many wonderful pets at our shelter- cats and dogs of all ages, shapes, sizes and breeds, waiting in hope for a home, someone to share life with, someone to love.</p>
      <p class="bold">Make adoption your first option – and find your friend for life today!</p>
